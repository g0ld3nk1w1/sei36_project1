# Project #1: The Game
Project 1 - Game - Turn Based Plants vs Zombie
An shoutout to a game that has evolved themselves while still catering to all ages. I myself have spent countless of hours in some of their releases. Here is the attempt of a reimagined classic of Plants vs Zombies; turn based, single player tower defense game.

## Technologies used
Html, Javascript, Css, Vite for dev.

## Installation instructions
TBD

## How to play
Every day, player earns 10 coins to purchase plants, clicking 'Play a Day!' would progress a day.
Plants can be placed on grass patches by selecting the plant that you wish to place in the grid.
Random number of zombies will appear on random grids on the  right and move towards your home.
Game ends when there are no zombies left or when the zombies reach your home.

## Approach taken
Plants, Zombies are objects, positions are tracked on a 2D Array.

## Unsolved Problems
<s>After game has ended, still can place plants.</s> solved on 13 May!
